# [H5-10] (julian.py) Here's a way of calculating the Julian date daynum of a year, which is the ordinal number of any
# date within the year. For example, January 1 is always Julian date 1, February 1 is Julian date 32, and December 31 is
# Julian date 365 in non-leap years and 366 in leap years. Use int arithmetic in these calculations:
# (1) daynum = 31*(monthâˆ’1) + day
# (2) If the month is after February subtract (4*month + 23) // 10 from daynum
# (3) If itâ€™s a leap year and after February 29, add 1 to daynum
# Using this algorithm, write a function julian(day,month,year) which returns the Julian date of its arguments. You may
# assume that year is not a leap year (skip step (3)).
# Define a main() function which reads the date from the user as three separate int values; you don't have to verify
# that it's valid.  Then call your function passing the input argument, and print the result. For 0.5 points of Extra
# Credit, add the leap year calculation in (3).
